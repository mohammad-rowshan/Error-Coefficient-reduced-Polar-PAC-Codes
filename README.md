The set of Python functions provided here are used to modify a polar code with information set I (here argument profile) and code length N and n=log2(N). 

Note that the main function is modify_profile.

The details of this procedure can be found on https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08843

Moreover, there is a MATLAB function that returns the minmum Hamming weight d_min of a prolar code (defined with set I) and the error coefficient (the total number of codewors minimum Hamming weight, A_dmin).
