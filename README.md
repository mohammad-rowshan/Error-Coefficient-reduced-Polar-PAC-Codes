The set of Python functions provided here are used to modify a polar code with information set I (here argument profile) and code length N and n=log2(N). 
Note that the main function is modify_profile.
The details of this procedure can be found on https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08843
Moreover, there is a MATLAB script that returns the minmum Hamming weight of a prolar code with set I and the error coefficient (the total number of codewors minimum Hamming weight).
